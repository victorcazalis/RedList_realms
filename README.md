# RedList_realms
Global map of realms fitting Red List SIS classification

This map has been drawn by hand in QGIS trying to match best the png image displayed in Red List SIS (see SIS_ecoregions_map.png). I used the Olson ecoregions map to guide the drawing in terrestrial parts. 
Note that this shapefile is quite coarse, I did not follow the Olson map with too many details.
